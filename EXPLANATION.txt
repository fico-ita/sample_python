# Explanation: Understanding the Meta-Labeling Approach in Financial Portfolio Construction

## 1. Introduction to Meta-Labeling

The evolution of the Meta-Labeling Approach in the financial landscape began with the foundational concepts introduced by LopezdePrado. These initial concepts laid the groundwork for further exploration and refinement. However, it was the TH quant firm's comprehensive articles that expanded upon these principles, providing a deeper understanding of Meta-Labeling and its applications within financial portfolio construction.

The TH firm's articles were instrumental in elucidating the primary and secondary models' functionality, shedding light on their significance in mitigating risks associated with financial bets. These articles not only explain the Meta-Labeling methodology but also provide comprehensive code repositories on GitHub, serving as practical guides for implementation.

## 2. Primary and Secondary Models

At the core of the Meta-Labeling methodology are the primary and secondary models. The primary model serves the pivotal role of predicting the directional aspect of positions, determining whether to take a buy or sell stance. Complementing this, the secondary model validates these predictions, thus enabling informed decisions on position sizing based on the reliability of the primary model's output. The reliability factor plays a crucial role in optimizing portfolio performance.

The implementation of these models necessitates a meticulous approach to data transformation, feature engineering, and model calibration to ensure robustness in predictions.

## 3. Reproducing and Extending TH Firm's Approach

The journey began with replicating TH firm's Meta-Labeling strategy using synthetic stock return data. This initial step aimed at not only comprehending the methodology but also ensuring accuracy in the implementation. Upon successfully replicating the results, confidence was established in the approach. This assurance paved the way for extending the methodology to a diversified stock portfolio, utilizing authentic FICO stock data.

### 3.1 Raw Data Transformation

The transformation of raw data into the Meta-Labeling format involved converting time series stock data into features for model training. This process included logarithmic return calculations, feature engineering to capture relevant patterns, and normalization of data. This process is critical as it lays the foundation for actionable insights derived from the Meta-Labeling approach.

### 3.2 Portfolio Construction Pipeline

The construction of the stock portfolio relied on a systematic pipeline. Beginning with the application of the Meta-Labeling strategy to all available stocks, the process involved ranking these stocks based on the degree of confidence in their predictions. Consequently, the top-ranked stocks were selected to form the portfolio.

## 4. Tearsheet Results and Insights

Upon implementing the Meta-Labeling strategy, comprehensive tearsheet results were generated. These results offered insights into the portfolio's performance, risk-adjusted returns, and model validation metrics. Notably, the portfolio exhibited [add specific insights or performance metrics obtained from the tearsheet analysis and their implications].

There are four benefits to using a well-understood process such as an AR(3) to

run a controlled experiment, rather than using real-life financial time series. 

First,by using a simple process, a researcher can more easily understand the working of
the technique itself. Second, by understanding how the data are generated, simple,
informative features can be used rather than introducing complex feature engineering
and proprietary datasets. Third, some of the problems associated with forecasting
financial time series can be avoided, such as nonlinear and interactive relationships
(Gu, Kelly, and Xiu 2020), heteroskedasticity (Engle 1982), and nonstationarity and
heavy tails (Cont 2001). Fourth, the risk of backtest overfitting is reduced because
the model is not repeatedly trained and scored on the same, single, path-dependent
series (Bailey and López de Prado 2014).

## 3. Reproducing and Extending TH Firm's Approach

The journey began with replicating H&T's Meta-Labeling strategy, which uses synthetic 
stock return data. Its primary model is a simple momentum strategy (predicted direction 
is the same as the previous observed one). The target variable (the meta-label) 
of the secondary model is “buy” if the next training return is positive and its 
features are the last three stocks returns.
