# Welcome to FICO

Created in 2023 by professors from graduate programs at the Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (ITA),
FICO-ITA is a multidisciplinary interest group in Computational Finance and Systematic Investments
operating within the ITA, in Brazil. This dynamic team teachs and researchs computational methods for the management
of systematic and quantitative investments. ([FICO](https://fico-ita.github.io/en/fico/))


## Project

This project constructs a stocks portfolio based on the MetaLabeling approach proposed by López de Prado[^1] and as implemented by Joubert[^2].

It is part of the requirements for the completion of the graduate course "PO-245. Aprendizado de Máquina em Finanças
Quantitativa" in 2023S2.

## Documentation Structure

The purpose of this documentation is to provide a thorough understanding of the methods and techniques used in the project. It also aims to offer insights into the path taken to solve the problem at hand.

While primarily designed for users of the solution, this documentation is also valuable for academics and practitioners looking to replicate and further develop the project.

The documentation is divided into four main sections, each serving a distinct purpose:


- [**Tutorials:**](tutorials.md) In this section, readers will find practical, hands-on documentation intended to facilitate learning through real-world applications of the solution.

- [**How-To Guides:**](how-to-guides.md) These guides present step-by-step instructions to ensure the proper functioning of the code and yields the expected results.

- [**Reference:**](reference.md) This section provides a detailed description of the methods and techniques used in the solution, offering valuable insights into how everything works.

- [**Explanation:**](explanation.md) This is a comprehensive resource that delves into the details of the solution. It aims to clarify the decisions made during the development process and provides valuable insights into the project's evolution.
