## 1. Initial Stock Selection - Exploratory Analysis

### Objective

Identify the top 10 stocks from the S&P 500 based on custom volatility and minimum momentum thresholds.

### Steps

**Data Collection and Preprocessing**

   - Gather historical stock data for all S&P 500 stocks.
   - Perform data preprocessing, including normalization and feature engineering.

**Volatility and Momentum Analysis**

   - Estimate mean volatility and momentum metrics for each stock.
   - If desirable, define custom thresholds for volatility and minimum momentum based on your calculations - or use the native values in this strategy.

**Selection Criteria**

   - Identify the top 10 stocks meeting the maximum volatility and minimum momentum score criterias.

Example Code:

## 2. Training the LSTM Neural Network

### Objective

Train the LSTM model using historical stock data to predict stock trends.

### Steps

**Data Preparation**

   - Collect historical stock data for the selected top 10 stocks.
   - Preprocess the data, including normalization and splitting into training and testing sets.

**Building the LSTM Model**

   - Compile the model with appropriate loss functions and optimizers.

**Training**

   - Fit the model to the training data.
   - Monitor and adjust hyperparameters to improve performance.

Example Code:

## 3. Stock Prediction and Portfolio Construction

### Objective

Utilize the trained LSTM model to predict the selected stocks' trends and build an investment wallet
with weights given to each stock based on predicted returns.

### Steps

**Predicting Stock Values**

   - Use the trained LSTM model to predict future stock values or trends.

**Portfolio Construction**

   - Analyze predicted values against actual performance.
   - Refine the selection criteria based on model outcomes.
